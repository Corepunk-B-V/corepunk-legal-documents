Where your data is processed for direct marketing purposes, you have the right to object at any time to its processing for such marketing. Where you object to processing for direct marketing purposes, your data shall no longer be processed for such purposes.

9. Protection of Your Data

We request our service providers which process your information on our behalf to themselves take a range of security measures designed to help protect your data. However, the Internet by its nature is not a secure environment and the nature of security risks is constantly evolving, as are the technical and organizational industry standards relating to management of those risks. The complete security of any personal information collected, stored or used by us or our service providers cannot therefore be guaranteed.


It is very important for you to understand that you control the security of your account to a great extent. You are advised to choose a password you don’t use on any other system and to change your password occasionally.
